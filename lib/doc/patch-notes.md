## 1. one osc band

[video]

independent record & playback rates set up one-to-many relationship with any sound. with two playheads both duplicating the input signal, things can get dense quickly â€“ rpls shines with a sparse input signal. a single voice becomes a symphony, with rpls adding the bassline and the treble, at rhythmic multiples & divitions of the source.

**input:** monophonic sine wave melody, synced to global clock

**key settings**
- clock mult: 4.0
- mix
  - vol 1: 0.5
  - vol 2: 1.0
- feedback
  - rec > rec: 0
  - 1 > rec: 0
  - 2 > rec: 0
- rates
  - rate rec: 1
  - rate 1: 2
  - rate 2: -1/2
- filter
  - hp: 0.21
  - lp: 0.6
  - q: 0.6


## 2. spiraling

[video]

subdivide & layer recent past arpeggiations and spiral upward. slight feedback from play head 2 (with a -2/1 ratio) creates an upward pitch & rhythm cascade by octaves, with playback direction flipping at each additional layer.

**input:** plucked synthesizer arpeggio, synced to global clock

**key settings**
- clock tempo: 48bpm
- clock mult: 1.0. increase to other whole number values to loop longer slices of the arp.
- mix
  - vol 1: 1.0
  - vol 2: 0.5
  - vol rec: 0.22
- rates. divide each rate by 2 to hear more recent, less layered slices of the past
  - rate rec: 2
  - rate 1: 1
  - rate 2: -4
- feedback
  - rec > rec: low, around 0.1
  - 1 > rec: 0
  - 2 > rec: very low, around 0.02. increase to raise the volume of octave pitch cascade.
- filter
  - hp: 0.25
  - lp: 0.7. set brightness of octave pitch cascade.
  - q: 0.6. adjusts icyness

## 3. circle of polyrhythms

[video]

variation of [spiraling](#2. spiraling), with an upward cascade at a ratio of 3/2. harmonies ascend in accordance with the circle of fifths while polyrythmic counterpoint begins at 3:2 and grows both faster & more complex with each additional feedback layer.

**input:** plucked synthesizer arpeggio, synced to global clock

**key settings**
- clock tempo: 45bpm
- clock mult: 1.0. increase to other whole number values to loop longer slices of the arp.
- mix
  - vol 1: 1.0
  - vol 2: 0.5

  - 2 > rec: 0
- filter
  - hp: 0.25
  - lp: 0.7. set brightness of pitch cascade.
  - q: 0.7. adjusts icyness

## 4. steam grains

[video]

with **clock mult** near-minimum, rpls traverses into the texural domain, forming a cloud of reipitched grains around the input signal. play with **clock mult** to affect grain size, and **fade** to effect pseudo-envelope quality & texture.

**input:** long envelope chords with noise

**key settings**
- clock tempo: 120bpm. affects grain size.
- clock mult: low, 0.0 - 1.0. affects grain size, very expressive.
- fade: 0.01 - 0.04. grain "envelope", affects texture.
- mix
  - vol 1: 0.8
  - vol 2: 1.0
- feedback
  - rec > rec: mid, 0.5-0.77
  - 1 > rec: 0
  - 2 > rec: 0
- rates
  - rate rec: 1
  - rate 1: 2
  - rate 2: -1/2
- filter
  - hp: 0.25
  - lp: 0.5 - 0.7
  - q: high, 0.6. emphasizes texture.

## 5. locked groove

[video]

[watch the full live set for cachedmedia]

the **freeze** button allows rpls to dip their toes into the varispeed looping universe ğŸ”‚. while playing with long delay lines, listen for just the right moment to jam K3 and loop the moment indefinitely. use rpls as a choppy rhymic base â€“ add additional layers with a second looper, or keep adding on in rpls by increasing **rec -> rec** feedback to 1.0 and unfreezing tempararily to accept more layers of sound while retaining the current conent.

**key settings**
- clock mult: 4.0. decrease to subdivide loop.
- freeze: ON. toggle OFF to fade out or add additional layers, depending on **rec > rec**.
- mix
  - vol 1: 0.5
  - vol 2: 1.0
- feedback
  - rec > rec: 0. increase to 1 to retain loop while unfrozen.
  - 1 > rec: 0
  - 2 > rec: 0


## 6. backup dancers

[video]

in rhythmic scenarios, playing an instrument into rpls is almost like having a digital companion playing along with you at divisions & multiples of the tempo. try playing your instrument and matching up your tempo with that of rpls.

**input:** small plucked or percussive instrument

**key settings**
- clock mult: 1.0, or whatever tempo you're feeling
- mix
  - vol 1: 0.5
  - vol 2: 1.0
- feedback
  - rec > rec: 0.5
  - 1 > rec: 0
  - 2 > rec: 0
- rates
  - rate rec: 1
  - rate 1: 2
  - rate 2: -1/2
